# Deep-Learning-in-Sports-Result-Prediction-
Several self-designed neural network models for NBA game result prediction, including single game, play-by-play and ranking.
I use Google Colab dring the whole project, and then I uploaded about half of my code here.
I would recommend anyone who actually wants to run the code to visit my google drive folder which includes all my code, NBA data, my data, and plots.
Here is the link. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LytgjgUHSfSxr0cgXDPOORyllg0aCujr?usp=sharing
I'm still working on the thesis, so it is not so organized yet.

Basically I have ranking prediction which uses 25% of previous season games data to predict the new season ranking. I also have a power ranking prediction when testing the models.
